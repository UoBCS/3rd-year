## What is a requirement?

Statement specifying what a product should do or how it should perform. It should be specific, unambiguous and clear.

## Types of functional requirements

### Functional & Data requirements

- Fundamental or essential subject matter of the product.
- Describe what the product has to do or what processing actions it is to take.
- Type volatility, size/amount persistence accuracy of data.

### Non functional

- Properties that the functions must have
- Describe the constraints that there are on the system and its development 
- Covers a number of aspects of design: image, usability, performance, maintainability, security, cultural acceptability, etc...
- These requirements are as important as the functional requirements for the product's success

### Environmental requirements

- Physical
- Social
- Organisational (user support, training etc...)
- Technological

## Personas

Good interaction design has a meaning only in the context of a person actually using it for some purpose.
The purpose of personas is to create reliable and realistic representations of your key audience segments for reference. These representations should be based on qualitative and some quantitative user research.
Different personas can represent a different kind of audience for the system. In interaction design usually there are more than one persona.

### Benefits of using personas

One of the most important benefits is focusing attention on the main user groups.
Personas also help to focus decisions surrounding system components by adding a layer of real-world consideration to the conversation.
It also helps avoiding getting insights from "elastic" users and conducting self-referential design.

### Personas hierarchy

- Primary/Focal persona (e.g. tourists/direct users of the tourism centre's booking system)
- Secondary persona (e.g. staff of tourism centre)
- Unimportant
- Affected (e.g. loss of job because of the implementation of a system)
- Anti-persona: people not in the target audience

### Constructing personas

- Collecting data about users
- Segment the users
- Create personas

For detailed steps see slides.

### Anatomy of a persona: 3 layer theory (Brown, 2011)

#### Layer 1

We establish the basic requirements such as:

- Name
- Key distinguishing features
- Descriptive dimensions
- Objectives and motivations
- Source

#### Layer 2

Elaborating relationships with the enviornment (context) and other individuals.

#### Layer 3

Humanise the persona:

- Personal background
- Photograph
- Demographic info
- Technology comfort level
