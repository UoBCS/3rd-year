## Interaction design

Interaction design is the design of interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives.
Design is a practical and creative activity, the ultimate intent of which is to develop a product that helps its users achieve their goals.

Developing a product must begin with gaining some understanding  of what is
required of it, but where do these requirements come from? Whom do you ask about them?
Underlying good interaction design is the philosophy of user-centered
design, i.e., involving users throughout development, but who are the users?

### Approach: User-centred design

Users are in the centre of the design process since its beginning. They are almost part of the design team.

### Approach: Activity-centred design

Focuses on behaviour around the tasks to be implemented.

### Approach: Systems design

Focuses on the system in general and the role of the user in it.

### Approach: Genius Design/Rapid Experd Design


### User centred approaches

In interaction design, we investigate the artifact's use and target domain by taking a user-centred approach to development. This means that users' concerns
direct the development rather than technical concerns.

When  users are  involved,  capturing  and  expressing  a  design  in  a  suitable  format  is  especially important  since  they  are  unlikely  to  understand  jargon  or  specialist  notations.

### Basic processes of interaction user-centred design

- Requirements gathering

- Designing alternatives: generating alternatives is a key in principle in most design disciplines, and one that should be encouraged in interaction design.
This activity can be broken up into 2 sub-activities:
	* Conceptual design: involves producing the conceptual model for the product which describes what the product should do, behave and look like.
	* Physical design: considers the detail of the products (i.e. colours, sounds, images to use, menus etc...).

- Prototyping/interactive versions of the product: it's not necessarily a software prototype; paper-based prototypes are very quick and cheap to build and very effective.

- Evaluating (measuring acceptability): evaluation is the process of determining the usability and acceptability of the product or design.
Interaction design requires a high level of user involvement throughout development, and this enchances the possibilities of an acceptable product being delivered.

### Key characteristics of the interaction design process

- User focus

- Specific usability criteria: should be identified, clearly documented, and agreed upon at the beginning of the project 

- Iteration: allows the design to refined based on feedback.

### Some practical issues

#### Who are the users?

As a starting point in the requirements gathering step we need to know who we consult to find out the users' requirements and needs.
However there are many interpretations of 'user'. The most obvious one is those people that interact directly with the system through an interface to achieve a task.

Other users are those who manage direct users (staff), those who receive products from the system, those who test the system, those who make the purchasing decision etc...
The group of stakeholders includes the development team itself as well as its
managers,  the  direct  users  and  their  managers,  recipients  of  the  productâ€™s output, people who may lose their jobs because of the introduction of the new product, and so on.

#### What do we mean by needs?

It's not a simple question. In fact people don't necessarily know what is possible. Instead, we  have  to  approach  it  by  understanding  the  characteristics
and  capabilities  of  the  users,  what  they  are  trying  to  achieve,  how  they  achieve  it
currently, and whether they would achieve their goals more effectively if they were supported differently.

It may be tempting for designers simply to design what they would like (i.e. genius/expert design), but their ideas would not necessarily coincide with those of the target user group.

### Interaction design lifecycle

A lifecycle interaction design model gives the designer an overall view of the development effort.
This model incorporates iteration and encourages a user focus.

The  only  factor  limiting  the  number  of  times  through
the cycle is the resources available, but whatever the number is, development ends
with an evaluation activity that ensures the final product meets the prescribed us-
ability criteria.
