## Fieldwork and ethnography

**Fieldwork** is the collection of information outside a laboratory, library or workplace setting. The approaches and methods used in field research vary across disciplines
**Ethnography** is a research process that uses fieldwork and observation to learn about a particular community or culture.

Ethnography is a qualitative research strategy, involving a combination of fieldwork and observation, which seeks to understand cultural phenomena that reflect the knowledge and system of meanings guiding the life of a cultural group. It was pioneered in the field of socio-cultural anthropology, but has also become a popular method in various other fields of social sciences, particularly in sociology.

The key characteristics of fieldwork are:

- Participant observation: this is done through interviews, direct observation, participation in the life of the group, collective discussions, analyses of personal documents produced within the group, self-analysis etc...
- Interpretation
- Analytical orientation

## Cultural and informational probes

Cultural probes (also known as diary studies) provide a way of gathering information about people and their activities.
Unlike direct observation (like usability testing or traditional field studies), the technique allows users to self-report.
Information gathered from cultural probes is particularly useful early in the design process.

### When are cultural probes appropriate?

Cultural probes are appropriate when you need to gather information from users with minimal influence on their actions, or when the process or event youâ€™re exploring takes place intermittently or over a long period.
For example, you could use cultural probes to explore how patients feel over the weeks or months following a surgical procedure, or how travelling salespeople manage their work.

### How are cultural probes conducted?

Selected participants are briefed, given a kit of materials, and briefed about the requirement to record or note specific events, feelings or interactions over a specified period.
Typically, a follow-up interview is conducted at some point after the briefing session. This helps ensure that participants are actively engaged, and are collecting the required information.
At the end of the specified period, the materials are collected and analysed.
A de-briefing session is also typically conducted, in order to supplement, validate and otherwise explore the information gathered by the participants.
Information gathered is then analysed, and documented in some fashion.

### Analysis and Documentation

Use affinity diagramming to analyse the data gathered. The data is also likely to be useful in creating personas, and this provides a good communication medium. Making participants' notes and photos available to project team members also provides a good way to communicate findings.

## Which method to choose?

We can use different methods and sometimes mix them (fieldwork with cultural probes etc..).

The criteria to choose the suitable method depends on the:

- Focus of the study
	* What are you trying to find out?
	* What stage of the design cycle we are at?
- Participants involved
- Available resources
- Available time

## Qualitative data analysis techniques

Qualitative methods can be used for pragmatic reasons in situations where formal and quantified fieldwork and research is not possible. Most quantitative fieldwork uses a strict 'route to enquiry' approach, whereas qualitative research can involve a more 'fluid' or recursive strategy. In this latter approach the hypotheses and questions may be manipulated and expanded as the research process evolves.

The content can be analysed on two levels:

- Basic level or the manifest level: a descriptive account of the data i.e. this is what was said, but no comments or theories as to why or how
- Higher level or latent level of analysis: a more interpretive analysis that is concerned with the response as well as what may have been inferred or implied

Steps:

- Get an overview of the data: To start making sense of the diverse range of materials collected as part of the qualitative process any notes firstly need to be presentable and readable. Any oral pieces of evidence such as tapes need to be transcribed.

- Thematic analysis: identifying recurring patterns or themes

- Categorise data

- Analyse critical incidents

### Two main approaches

- Top-down: knowing what you're looking for and coding specifically for that. We might begin with thinking up a theory about our topic of interest. We then narrow that down into more specific hypotheses that we can test. We narrow down even further when we collect observations to address the hypotheses. This ultimately leads us to be able to test the hypotheses with specific data -- a confirmation (or not) of our original theories.
- Bottom-up: we begin with specific observations and measures, begin to detect patterns and regularities, formulate some tentative hypotheses that we can explore, and finally end up developing some general conclusions or theories.

### Coding data

Coding is the process of combing the data for themes, ideas and categories and then marking similar passages of text with a code label so that they can easily be retrieved at a later stage for further comparison and analysis. Coding the data makes it easier to search the data, to make comparisons and to identify any patterns that require further investigation.

Codes can be based on:

- Themes, Topics
- Ideas, Concepts
- Terms, Phrases
- Keywords

It is possible to start coding with themes identified from a priori ideas such as pre-existing theories or just to let new codes emerge from your data set as you read it (grounded theory).

#### Open coding

At this first level of coding, you are looking for distinct concepts and categories in the data, which will form the basic units of your analysis. In other words, you are breaking down the data into first level concepts, or master headings, and second-level categories, or subheadings.

#### Axial coding

In open coding, you were focused primarily on the text to define concepts and categories. In axial coding, you are using your concepts and categories while re-reading the text to
1. Confirm that your concepts and categories accurately represent interview responses and
2. Explore how your concepts and categories are related.
